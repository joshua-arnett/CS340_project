        "The Toy Chest‚Äù toy store sells about 100 toys per month. They currently have 20 employees and make approximately $650 monthly. As they are expanding their workforce and selling more toys, there needs to be a way to keep track of toy orders, employee positions, and total revenue earned. A database-driven website will keep track of toy Orders from Customers, the Employees handling the Orders, and which Departments the Employees come from.
